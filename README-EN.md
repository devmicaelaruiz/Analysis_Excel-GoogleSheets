# Analysis Projects with Excel and Google Sheets

Welcome to the repository of analysis projects using Excel and Google Sheets! As a student of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Engineering, my goal is to share a series of practical and applied projects that demonstrate the power and versatility of these widely used tools in the field of data science.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects addressing various common issues and challenges in data analysis. From basic data cleaning and manipulation tasks to more advanced exploratory analysis and result visualization, each project is designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

## Why Excel and Google Sheets?

Both Excel and Google Sheets are widely accessible and familiar tools for a broad audience. While there are more specialized platforms for data analysis, these two applications offer an accessible and user-friendly entry point into the world of data analysis. Additionally, their flexibility and cloud collaboration capabilities make them ideal for teamwork and result sharing.

## Repository Content

The projects included in this repository cover a variety of topics and techniques, including:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Trend and pattern analysis.
- Data visualization.
- Implementation of advanced formulas and functions.
- Integration with other tools and programming languages.

## Contributions and Collaboration

Your participation is welcome! If you have ideas for new projects, improvements, or corrections for existing ones, feel free to contribute to the repository. Together, we can create an invaluable collection of resources for those interested in exploring and mastering data analysis with Excel and Google Sheets.

I hope you find these projects useful and educational! Enjoy exploring and learning!
